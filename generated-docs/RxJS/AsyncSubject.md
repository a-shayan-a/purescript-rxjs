## Module RxJS.AsyncSubject

#### `AsyncSubject`

``` purescript
data AsyncSubject :: Type -> Type
```

Please see [RxJS Version 5.* documentation](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) for
additional details on proper usage of the library.

##### Instances
``` purescript
Functor AsyncSubject
Apply AsyncSubject
Applicative AsyncSubject
Bind AsyncSubject
Monad AsyncSubject
Semigroup (AsyncSubject a)
Alt AsyncSubject
Plus AsyncSubject
Alternative AsyncSubject
MonadZero AsyncSubject
MonadPlus AsyncSubject
```

#### `observeOn`

``` purescript
observeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject a
```

Makes every `next` call run in the new Scheduler.

#### `subscribeOn`

``` purescript
subscribeOn :: forall a. Scheduler -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject a
```

Makes subscription happen on a given Scheduler.

#### `subscribe`

``` purescript
subscribe :: forall a e. Subscriber a -> AsyncSubject a -> Eff e Subscription
```

Subscribing to an AsyncSubject is like calling a function, providing
`next`, `error` and `completed` effects to which the data will be delivered.

#### `subscribeNext`

``` purescript
subscribeNext :: forall a e. (a -> Eff e Unit) -> AsyncSubject a -> Eff e Subscription
```

#### `just`

``` purescript
just :: forall a. a -> AsyncSubject a
```

Creates an AsyncSubject that emits the value specify,
and then emits a complete notification.  An alias for `of`.

#### `asObservable`

``` purescript
asObservable :: forall a. AsyncSubject a -> Observable a
```

Create an Observable from a AsyncSubject

#### `buffer`

``` purescript
buffer :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject b -> AsyncSubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the first AsyncSubject into an Array, and emits that array only when
second AsyncSubject emits.

#### `bufferCount`

``` purescript
bufferCount :: forall a. Int -> Int -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the past as an array, emits that array when
its size (arg1) reaches the specified buffer size, and starts a new buffer.
The new buffer starts with nth (arg2) element of the AsyncSubject counting
from the beginning of the *last* buffer.

#### `bufferToggle`

``` purescript
bufferToggle :: forall a b c. (AsyncSubject a) -> (AsyncSubject b) -> (b -> AsyncSubject c) -> (AsyncSubject (Array a))
```

Collects values from the source AsyncSubject (arg1) as an array. Starts collecting only when
the opening (arg2) AsyncSubject emits, and calls the closingSelector function (arg3) to get an AsyncSubject
that decides when to close the buffer.  Another buffer opens when the
opening AsyncSubject emits its next value.

#### `bufferWhen`

``` purescript
bufferWhen :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> AsyncSubject b) -> AsyncSubject (Array a)
```

Collects values from the past as an array. When it starts collecting values,
it calls a function that returns an AsyncSubject that emits to close the
buffer and restart collecting.

#### `concatMap`

``` purescript
concatMap :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> AsyncSubject b) -> AsyncSubject b
```

Equivalent to mergeMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that, unlike mergeMap,
the next bind will not run until the AsyncSubject generated by the projection function (arg2)
completes.  That is, composition is sequential, not concurrent.
Warning: if source values arrive endlessly and faster than their corresponding
inner AsyncSubjects can complete, it will result in memory issues as inner
AsyncSubjects amass in an unbounded buffer waiting for their turn to be subscribed to.

#### `concatMapTo`

``` purescript
concatMapTo :: forall a b c. AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject b -> (a -> b -> AsyncSubject c) -> AsyncSubject c
```

The type signature explains it best.  Warning: Like `concatMap`, composition is sequential.

#### `every`

``` purescript
every :: forall a. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> Boolean) -> AsyncSubject Boolean
```

Determines whether all elements of an AsyncSubject satisfy a condition.
Returns an AsyncSubject containing a single element determining whether all
elements in the source AsyncSubject pass the test in the specified predicate.

#### `exhaustMap`

``` purescript
exhaustMap :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> AsyncSubject b) -> AsyncSubject b
```

It's Like concatMap (a.k.a, `>>=`) EXCEPT that it ignores every new projected
AsyncSubject if the previous projected AsyncSubject has not yet completed.

#### `expand`

``` purescript
expand :: forall a. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> AsyncSubject a) -> AsyncSubject a
```

It's similar to mergeMap, but applies the projection function to every source
value as well as every output value. It's recursive.

#### `groupBy`

``` purescript
groupBy :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject (AsyncSubject a)
```

Groups the items emitted by an AsyncSubject (arg2) according to the value
returned by the grouping function (arg1).  Each group becomes its own
AsyncSubject.

#### `mapTo`

``` purescript
mapTo :: forall a b. b -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject b
```

Emits the given constant value on the output AsyncSubject every time
the source AsyncSubject emits a value.

#### `mergeMap`

``` purescript
mergeMap :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> AsyncSubject b) -> AsyncSubject b
```

Maps each value to an AsyncSubject, then flattens all of these AsyncSubjects
using mergeAll.  It's just monadic `bind`.

#### `mergeMapTo`

``` purescript
mergeMapTo :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject b -> AsyncSubject b
```

Maps each value of the AsyncSubject (arg1) to the same inner AsyncSubject (arg2),
then flattens the result.

#### `pairwise`

``` purescript
pairwise :: forall a. AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject (Array a)
```

Puts the current value and previous value together as an array, and emits that.

#### `partition`

``` purescript
partition :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> AsyncSubject a -> Array (AsyncSubject a)
```

Given a predicate function (arg1), and an AsyncSubject (arg2), it outputs a
two element array of partitioned values
(i.e., [ AsyncSubject valuesThatPassPredicate, AsyncSubject valuesThatFailPredicate ]).

#### `scan`

``` purescript
scan :: forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject b
```

Given an accumulator function (arg1), an initial value (arg2), and
a source AsyncSubject (arg3), it returns an AsyncSubject that emits the current
accumlation whenever the source emits a value.

#### `switchMap`

``` purescript
switchMap :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> (a -> AsyncSubject b) -> AsyncSubject b
```

Projects each source value to an AsyncSubject which is merged in the output
AsyncSubject, emitting values only from the most recently projected AsyncSubject.

#### `switchMapTo`

``` purescript
switchMapTo :: forall a b. AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject b -> AsyncSubject b
```

#### `windowTime`

``` purescript
windowTime :: forall a. Int -> Int -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject (AsyncSubject a)
```

It's like bufferTime, but emits a nested AsyncSubject instead of an array,
and it doesn't take a maximum size parameter.  arg1 is how long to
buffer items into a new AsyncSubject, arg2 is the when the next buffer should begin,
and arg3 is the source AsyncSubject.

#### `windowToggle`

``` purescript
windowToggle :: forall a b c. (AsyncSubject a) -> (AsyncSubject b) -> (b -> AsyncSubject c) -> (AsyncSubject (Array a))
```

It's like bufferToggle, but emits a nested AsyncSubject instead of an array.

sampleTime :: forall a. Int -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject a
```

Periodically looks at the source AsyncSubject and emits whichever
value it has most recently emitted since the previous sampling, unless the source has not emitted anything since the previous sampling.

```

It's like throttleTime, but the silencing duration is determined by a second AsyncSubject.

#### `throttleTime`

``` purescript
throttleTime :: forall a. Int -> AsyncSubject a -> AsyncSubject a

determine the value to be emitted on the output AsyncSubject.

#### `zip`

``` purescript
zip :: forall a. Array (AsyncSubject a) -> AsyncSubject (Array a)
```

Waits for each AsyncSubject to emit a value. Once this occurs, all values
with the corresponding index will be emitted. This will continue until at
least one inner AsyncSubject completes.
